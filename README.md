At the Hackathon, the task was:
" The aim of this task is to correctly classify fruit photos using techniques
machine learning. We set the expected classification efficiency at over 75%.
test set. Below is a piece of code that must be completed for the script to work properly,
by running completely and generating a model.pth (or model.keras) file. Runtime environment for
Jupyter notebook will be used for this task and Google Colab can be used as a platform. "

This is my version of such a machine written in Python using PyTorch
